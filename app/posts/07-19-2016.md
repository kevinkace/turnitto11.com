Working on the website today after thinking about it in bed last night. It's going to be incredibly simple for now:

- splash page with title and link to continue
- continue link loads most recent post
- each post has navigation to previous/next post
- backend will be [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for routing/rendering, and [Mithril](http://mithril.js.org/) for templating/modules.
