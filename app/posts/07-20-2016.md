Making good progress on the website, and no reason not to as it's so small; there's only 3 routes:

- / = home
- /posts = most recent post
- /posts/:id = specific post

Will need to set up a couple npm scripts to run the app, process CSS, and whatever else is needed.

Goal is to get this running on my Digital Ocean droplet tonight.
