I also edited some electronics assembly video for the [site background](https://github.com/kevinkace/turnitto11.com/blob/master/public/vid/turn11.mp4) (to be replaced with footage of the truck once purchased/setup).

I still have a couple [Colour](http://www.diyrecordingequipment.com/collections/colour) modules to assemble. Once done I'm going to try out the channel routing in the [CAPI VPR rack](http://capi-gear.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=87_89_182&products_id=367): VP26 => Colour on some kick/snare combos.
