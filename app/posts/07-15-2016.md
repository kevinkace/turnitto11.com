Number 3 of the daily posts, today continuing on the business pitch and more financial forecasting, (my Magic 8-ball has never had such a workout). Highlights:

* Using the low estimate for startup/operating costs, and low estimate for sales, the break even point is about 14 months.
* Low estimate for startup/operating costs, high estimate for sales, the break even point is about 6 months.
* High estimate for startup/operating costs, low estimate for sales, the break even point is past the 2 year mark.
* High estimate for startup/operating costs, high estimate for sales, the break even point is at 13 months.

I don't plan on this ever being a full time job, so it would be hard to increase the high sales estimates beyond what they're at. It's also unrealistic to think I'll be fighting off hordes of paying customers (music biz lol).My best of chance of staying profitable within 12 months are to keep operating expenses low.
