I've kinda gotten into a situation I was hoping to avoid: taking WAY TOO LONG to build a site. 

The goal was to build a simple site (done), and not spend a long time styling or getting bogged down in the technical implementations. But I found myself refactoring to a [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) just to build a `classes.json` file for [modular-css](https://github.com/tivac/modular-css) CSS file. Screw all that though, I'll just reference the generated class names directly and hopefully they're dependable.

Last night the replacement [gar2520](http://capi-gear.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=136) arrived, and took most of the night to build it. I took some videos of the process that I'm pretty stoked on which I hope to use as video backgrounds for the site.

Today I hope to get the basics of site styles DONE. Weekend is still open for planning.

And wow, living in the future.

Well on the [second try](https://github.com/kevinkace/turnitto11.com/commit/1b2f049fd9a0936f330b46a45afad276972703cb).
