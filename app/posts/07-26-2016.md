I didn't get the site launched last night :( I couldn't figure out the custom module loader for nodejs, but think I figured out what I was doing wrong and hope to get it live tonight.

Update: It's working! Site is ready to go live, but it's late so tomorrow morning.

Today I read through an article: [The 20 Best Compressors of All Time](https://www.attackmagazine.com/reviews/the-best/top-20-best-hardware-compressors-ever-made/), which was actually pretty good refresher. Although I would like to have a couple channels of [1176](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1176_Peak_Limiter), I'm never going to have that much outboard dynamic processing; it's just not practical. So I'd like to cross reference the digital emulators I have with their hardware counterpart.

Lastly it's election season right now, and it's pretty bleak, but trying to not let it get me down. '~'
