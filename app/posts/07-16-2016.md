This morning I finished up the business pitch I'd been working on, which means I'll be working on the full business plan next. Business pitch served 2 roles for me:

1. Serves as a high level outline for the business plan.
2. Fast turnaround, sense of accomplishment!

And now that it's done, let me take another moment to look it over... Yup that feels great!

For the business plan I will need to spend much more time on the financial components.

- How will the money be injected
- Repayment (lol)
- Income and expense projections
- Startup costs

But for today and the rest of the weekend I might take on some of the more fun work: selling some old gear, looking into new gear, and starting web presence (to have a place for these posts I'm making).

Next week will be *The Business Plan*...
