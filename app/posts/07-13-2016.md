In 2004 I had the opportunity to work alongside Doug McClement of [LiveWire Remote Recorders](http://www.livewireremote.com/) to record a band performing live, while attending [The Harris Institute](http://www.harrisinstitute.com/) in Toronto, Canada. His studio is a 32 foot trailer with an expanding wall, that contains a 5.1 surround, 128 track ProTool HD studio designed by [Pilchner-Schoustal](http://www.pilchner-schoustal.com/). It's pretty impressive, and it always stuck with me as an interesting approach to recording.

I've worked in studios, notably [Find A Way](http://www.findaway.ca/) and [Robeter Productions](http://robeterproductions.com/). I worked for [Steinberg Canada](http://www.musicmarketing.ca/index.php) as a product specialist. But after moving to Seattle in 2006 I started doing less music and more web development, go figure. Professionally at least. Which I love, and it's allowed me to put together a pretty solid home studio, but without a great space to use it.

So I'm going to do it. 

Buy a truck. Put a studio in it. Record stuff.

That's the plan. I'm not sure if I can actually pull it off. My track record for stuff like this is... not great, but I'm trying to be smarter about it this time. And this post is part of that; documentation to keep track of progress. Trello is great for small task tracking, which I've been using on and off as needed for the last few years. Google Drive and Docs are great so far, though no Markdown support (I'm using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io) on PC and iA Writer on Android). Slicing up time into very discrete chunks can be fun, "10 minutes, go!". And of course milestones (always so accurate lol).

Anyway, my list atm:

Front-loading with all the annoying, un-fun parts. And it's a pretty aggressive schedule.

Wish me luck!
