Yesterday I micd up the old drum kit, mostly to test out the 4 new [CAPI VP26s](http://capi-gear.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=22_117_55_56&products_id=481). Well, I'm only able to test 3 as I blew it while building the first [gar2520 opamp](http://capi-gear.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=22_117_55_56&products_id=136) (had 2 opamps swapped, and now that they're in their correct spot the opamp is quite distorted :-1:. I wanted to try a bit of a different sound; darker and smoother than the usual bombastic in-your-face aggression I usually like. So it's a good time to try out different mic configurations.

Tried using the Chameleon Labs TS-2 (large diaphragm, multi pattern tube mic) but powered on with just a flicker and now not working at all. So I'll be taking that apart today. Well just took it apart, couldn't see anything wrong, swapped the fuse (which was the first thing I checked), re-inserted the AC cable, and now it works... Amazing.

Bought some new hats (darker, used Sabina) and moongels. Started with the Apollo (kit) snare but switched to the smaller snare.

Overall I got some ok recordings, not quite what I was going for. I'll need to get some gobos. And on that note let me start up a long list of things to buy...

I was also intended to post some old gear to sell, but instead re-racked it :X. Though cheap (and probably unreliable), it's nice to have options. One day I'll buy some high-voltage tube preamps and fully retire the ART gear.
